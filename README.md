## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Notes:
  Weedmaps.com's backend seems to hiccup at keeping track of where a deal is. Often i find that one store with multiple deals will have
some of those deals spread across several subregions, despite how they show up on the website.

  Future updates will hopefully fix this issue by implementing my own sorting routine. Until then, make sure to look at all regions near yours!
